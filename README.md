# rl-2ngine
## About
rl-2ngine is a Python roguelike engine that uses tcod and tcod-ecs. 

This is my second serious attempt at creating such an engine, hence the 2. (If I fail this time as well, the next version will be called rl-3ngine.)

## Roadmap
- [x] UI states
- [x] Actors; player actor
- [x] Actions
- [x] Player-centric camera
- [x] Turn queue
- [x] Movement
- [x] Basic melee combat
- [x] Items; inventory; picking up and dropping items
- [ ] Better items UI
- [ ] FOV
- [ ] Equippables; weapons, armor that modify attributes
- [ ] Consumables
- [ ] Multi-turn effects
- [ ] Dungeon levels and staircases
- [ ] Monsters don't initially see / lose track of the player
- [ ] Interactible terrain (openable doors, etc.)

Notable absent from this roadmap is procedural generation, which is game-specific and will therefore not be implemented in an engine.
